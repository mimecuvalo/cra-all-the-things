<strong>NOTE: still under active development and I'm not currently providing backwards compatibility until things stabilize.</strong>

## üìØ Description

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

- [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) ‚Äì How to create a new app.
- [User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) ‚Äì How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## üíæ Install

```sh
npx create-react-app react-all-the-things --use-npm --scripts-version=cra-all-the-things
```

Then, to run your newly created server locally, **with** the Storybook styleguide server:

```sh
npm start
```

Or, to run locally **without** the Storybook styleguide server:

```sh
npm run serve:dev
```

In dev or prod you'll want to setup your environment as well. Check out the `.env.example` file and `mv` it to `.env.development.local` (or `.env` for prod) and set the various variables:

- `REACT_APP_DB*` for your database
- `REACT_APP_SESSION_SECRET` for session management
- `REACT_APP_AUTH0*` variables if you would like to use Auth0 for logging in

To run in production (or better yet check out bin/flightplan.js)
```sh
npm --production install
npm run build
npm run serve:prod
```

To run tests:
```sh
npm run test
```

### üî® Development (of this meta-repo, not of the repo created by the npx command above)

To run locally, **with** the Storybook styleguide server:
```sh
yarn
cd packages/react-scripts  # TODO(mime) need to get rid of this command eventually - it's a crutch
npm install
cd ../../
yarn start
```

To run locally, **without** the Storybook styleguide server:

```sh
yarn serve:dev
```

To run tests:

```sh
yarn:test
```

To change port, in an `.env` change the values to what you desire:
```sh
PORT=3000
REACT_APP_SSR_PORT=3001
```

## ‚ö° Features

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### p0 (high pri)

- webpackbar

- setup docker to start with?
- CI integration, for own repo and template
  - perhaps, Danger JS
- provide escape hatches, modularity
- what learnings from react-server, next.js, razzle, suicrux, react-redux-universal-hot-example, and others https://reactjs.org/community/starter-kits.html?
- fix up tests
  - test for example repo
  - need to fix up test to accept decorators
  - fix e2e-simple test
- flesh out TypeScript template (syncing `template-typescript` with `template`)
- PWA, explore enabling by default (desktop PWA, too?) - but probably won't
  - https://hnpwa.com/
  - https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app
  - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/
  - https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/pwacompat
  - https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/caching-files-with-service-worker
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/
  - asset-manifest: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5513
- more GraphQL examples:
  - fragments
  - local state
  - subscriptions
  - check out dataloader: https://github.com/graphql/dataloader
  - generate automatically schemas/typedefs
- graphql not logged in should be 401 not 500, AuthenticationError vs ForbiddenError
all-the-things apple-touch icon missing/android-chrome
- add material-ui theme
- fix up npm run test
- generator steps for Sequelize files

### p1 (medium pri)

- maybe SASS
- maybe shared css/js constants file
- maybe event listener decorator for events on an react component
- recommend better secrets service: https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/secrets-as-a-service
- look at persisting csurf across server restarts
- go through Flow warnings / add type annotations
- common css mixins file needed still? e.g. ellipsize, and color palette
- admin panel, separate webpack entry point/code split
  - REPL
  - exception collector
  - system info
  - add docusaurus / read the docs (for this repo and template)
- authentication - add ability to refresh tokens (auth0)
- keygrip for signing cookies
- update createNonceAndSetCSP - probably have to intercept entry file and add nonce manually for webpack dynamically loaded js, then might not need csp at nginx layer
- finish up ‚Äòconfiguration.js‚Äô - should be usable server-side
- create staticUrl function for cache busting upon new versions (using git hash, images and other static files)
- create buildUrl functionality (copy over from helloworld project)
- i18n features
  - package name to avoid conflicts
  - message extractor
  - polyfill for `Intl` for older browsers
  - highlight missing translations
  - add fallback capability
  - RTL
- experiments framework
- make source-map-explorer script work on arbitrary files in webpack
- add "test:debug" to scripts for [chrome testing](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/debugging-tests)
- more tests and https://coveralls.io
- background tasks (if anything, at least via cron)
- bundle analyzers (bundlesize, webpack-bundle-analyzer, webpack-dashboard)
- ability to config repo (add name/email to Markdown docs at least)
- GitHub PR request, show infobar of impact of PR
- redux
- different DB? maybe mongodb?
- web components? (e.g. check out youtube.com)
- update `npm eject`
- development of this repo: shouldn‚Äôt need to do yarn and then npm install in react-scripts
- getCSSModuleLocalIdent causes problems with flightplan.js, should be able to build first and *then* link over new prod build but currently doing vice-versa unfortunately.

### p2 (ideas)

- look at/switch over to React Hooks
- dev mode, sqllite
- staging / canary server flags
- lazy load image capability
- event bus
- Redis
- take a look at sanitize.css
- immutability, via immutable.js / immer
- fp: ramda, observables, rxjs
- serve.js currently uses a bundle.js server-side which gives crap stack traces. some beautiful day we wouldn't need to use webpack basically when we just went to be able to require the constructApps function directly!

### üî≠ Things to explore (experimental roadmap)

- be more package-y, choose 'some-of-the-things' :)
- explore Koa
- explore Next.js
